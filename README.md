# **_Brick Heroes - Project Portfolio 5_**

Welcome to Brick Heroes, a vibrant, comic-book-inspired subscription service designed for LEGO enthusiasts of all ages! This innovative platform offers users the ability to borrow LEGO sets instead of purchasing them, making high-quality LEGO building more affordable, accessible, and sustainable.

Traditional LEGO collections can be expensive and take up space over time. With Brick Heroes, users can subscribe to a monthly plan, choose sets they want to build, borrow them for as long as they need, and return them to borrow new ones. This cycle allows for continuous creativity while reducing costs and waste.

# Website Objectives

The Brick Heroes website is designed to provide a comprehensive platform for users to explore and purchase Lego sets through a subscription-based model. The primary goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly space that empowers builders of all ages to access a wide variety of Lego sets affordably, while also promoting sustainability through the reuse of sets. The site integrates borrowing functionality and e-commerce subscription management, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

Additionally, Brick Heroes aims to foster a creative community of Lego enthusiasts by offering features such as a Facebook page where customers can share building tips, share creations, and the ability to leave reviews and feedback on borrowed sets. The website's design reflects a vibrant, comic-book-inspired theme to make the browsing and interaction experience fun and memorable.

# Agile Methodology

## Agile Methodology

Throughout the development of the Brick Heroes platform, Agile methodology was implemented to ensure the project was completed efficiently while remaining flexible to evolving requirements. This iterative approach emphasized incremental delivery, continuous improvement, and alignment with user needs, allowing the project to adapt as feedback was incorporated. Agile principles helped manage the project's scope, prioritise key features, and maintain a high standard of quality.

### Key Agile Practices Utilised:

1. **Sprint Planning and Milestones**

The development process was broken into multiple milestones, each representing a major feature or section of the site (e.g., User Authentication, Subscription Management, Borrowing and Returning Lego Sets).

  - Each milestone was treated as a sprint, with specific goals and a clear timeline for delivery.
  - Deadlines were set for each sprint but remained flexible, allowing adjustments to address high-priority features first or respond to feedback.
  - Examples of milestones included:
      - Setting up the user authentication system.
      - Developing the borrowing and returning workflows.
      - Implementing e-commerce functionality for subscriptions and potential future ecommerce options.

This iterative structure ensured steady progress while maintaining the flexibility to pivot when necessary.

2. **User Stories**

User stories were at the heart of the development process, capturing features and functionality from the perspective of different user types (e.g., subscribers, admins, and visitors).

  - Each user story was written to reflect specific user goals, helping to focus on delivering value.
  - Prioritisation followed the MoSCoW framework:
      - Must Have: Core functionality like account registration, borrowing Lego sets, and subscription management.
      - Should Have: Features enhancing usability, such as filtering Lego sets by theme or difficulty.
      - Could Have: Community features like buying gift cards and sets, a blog for sharing Lego creations or commenting on blog posts.
  - User stories provided clear acceptance criteria to guide development and testing, ensuring that each feature met user expectations.

3. **GitHub Project Board**

A dedicated GitHub Projects board was created to organise and track tasks, user stories, and features.

  - The board was divided into columns, such as:
      - Backlog: Features or tasks awaiting prioritisation.
      - In Progress: Current tasks under development.
      - Testing: Completed tasks undergoing testing and validation.
      - Done: Completed and deployed features.
  - Each user story was assigned to its relevant sprint and tracked on the board to ensure visibility into the development process.
  - For example, once the "Implement Monthly Subscription Workflow" user story was completed, it was moved from In Progress to Done.

This structure provided transparency, allowed blockers to be identified early, and ensured smooth progress through each sprint.

4. **Regular Retrospectives**

At the end of each sprint, retrospectives were conducted to reflect on the process and identify areas for improvement.

  - Key questions included:
      - What went well?
      - What challenges were encountered?
      - What can be improved in the next sprint?
  - Retrospectives allowed for:
      - Addressing technical debt.
      - Streamlining processes to improve delivery times.
      - Enhancing collaboration and decision-making for future tasks.

These reflective sessions ensured the development process remained agile and adaptable.

5. **Continuous Integration and Testing**

To maintain a robust and reliable codebase, continuous integration principles were applied.

  - Each feature was developed and tested in isolation, ensuring it met the acceptance criteria before being integrated into the main project.
  - Testing focused on:
      - Functional testing for core features (e.g., borrowing Lego sets, subscription management).
      - Validation of edge cases (e.g., handling expired subscriptions or unavailable sets).
   - Automated tests were created for critical features to ensure they worked as intended across updates.
   - Any issues identified during testing were documented in GitHub Issues and addressed promptly, preventing regressions and maintaining site stability.

6. **Prioritisation Using MoSCoW**

The MoSCoW method was used to prioritize user stories and features systematically:

  - Must Have: User registration, borrowing and returning Lego sets, subscription payments.
  - Should Have: User reviews and ratings for Lego sets, notifications.
  -	Could Have: A gallery for users to share their builds, blog area, purchasing of sets and giftcards.
  - Wonâ€™t Have: Features planned for future phases, like multi-language support or advanced analytics for users.

This approach ensured that critical functionality was delivered first while leaving room for enhancements later in the project lifecycle.
