![CSS Validator](docs/readme_images/css.png)

### Javascript Testing

All custom JavaScript code was validated using the JSHint Validator. No critical errors were found during the validation process. A few minor warnings were flagged, primarily related to ES6 syntax (const, => arrow functions) and undefined variables ($). These warnings do not impact the functionality of the code, as ES6 is fully supported in modern browsers.

All tested templates and functionalities work as expected without issues.

## Responsivity Tests

Throughout the development of the Brick Heroes website, extensive testing was conducted to ensure its responsive design across various devices. Using Chrome Dev Tools, I simulated different screen sizes and orientations to verify that all elements, including navigation, product detail pages, and user forms, displayed correctly and functioned seamlessly on a wide range of devices. This testing process was integrated into the development workflow to maintain consistent layout and functionality across screen sizes.

Upon completion, additional testing was conducted using the Responsinator tool to evaluate the site's performance on different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The site was assessed for screen widths starting at 280 pixels, confirming that there were no issues with stretching, pixelation, or horizontal scrolling. All components, including images, buttons, and text, aligned as expected, maintaining visual integrity and usability on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

To further ensure responsive behavior, manual tests were performed on physical devices such as smartphones and tablets. This helped validate touch interactions, button sizes, and overall layout, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience across all platforms.

The results of these tests, including the range of screen sizes tested, confirm that the Donegal Explorers site adapts effectively to a variety of devices and screen resolutions.

## Accessibility Testing

Ensuring an inclusive and user-friendly experience was a core aspect of developing **Brick Heroes**. The website was designed and tested to be accessible for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies. The following measures were implemented to meet **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** and improve usability:

### 1. **Color Contrast**
Text and background colors were carefully selected to meet WCAG 2.1 contrast standards, ensuring readability for users with low vision or color blindness. Tools such as **WebAIM Contrast Checker** and **Chrome DevTools** were used to verify compliance, ensuring a strong contrast ratio across the site.

### 2. **Logical Heading Structure**
A well-organized heading hierarchy (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) was maintained across all pages. This improves navigation for screen reader users, allowing them to jump between sections efficiently. Headings were structured meaningfully to enhance content readability.

### 3. **Use of Semantic HTML**
The website was built with semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to provide clear page organization. This improves how assistive technologies interpret and announce content, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 4. **Alternative Text for Images**
All images, including product photos and icons, were assigned descriptive **alt text** to assist visually impaired users. Decorative images were assigned `alt=""` so screen readers can skip them, preventing unnecessary interruptions.

### 5. **ARIA Attributes for Interactive Elements**
ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes were applied to **buttons, links, forms, and alerts** to ensure they are fully accessible. Elements such as dropdowns, form fields, and notifications include `aria-labels` or `aria-describedby` to provide additional context for users navigating with screen readers.

### 6. **Keyboard Navigation Compatibility**
The entire website, including navigation menus, product pages, and forms, was tested for full **keyboard accessibility**. Users can navigate without a mouse using the **Tab, Enter, and Arrow keys**, ensuring that all interactive elements are reachable and functional.

### 7. **Accessible Forms and Validation**
All forms, including **sign-up, login, and subscription checkout**, were designed with accessibility in mind. Labels and placeholders provide clear guidance, while validation messages are linked to their respective fields using **ARIA attributes** (`aria-describedby`) for better clarity.

### 8. **Screen Reader-Friendly Controls**
Interactive elements, such as **subscription buttons, borrow requests, and checkout steps**, were tested with screen readers to ensure clarity. Labels and focus indicators were added where necessary to enhance usability.

### 9. **Language Declaration**
The HTML document includes `lang="en"` to define English as the primary language. This helps screen readers **interpret and pronounce text correctly**, improving comprehension for non-visual users.

### 10. **Accessibility Testing Methods**
To verify compliance, the following tools and techniques were used:
- **Automated Testing**: Lighthouse, WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, Axe DevTools
- **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, NVDA screen reader testing
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Chrome DevTools accessibility audit

By implementing these accessibility best practices, **Brick Heroes** ensures that all users, regardless of ability, can enjoy a seamless and engaging experience on the platform.

## Automated Testing


Automated testing was implemented to validate the core functionality of **Brick Heroes**, ensuring that the subscription system, borrowing process, and product management features function as expected. Testing was primarily focused on verifying that forms correctly validated input, views rendered the appropriate responses, and key business logic, such as borrowing limits and subscription renewals, behaved as expected.

### Forms Testing
Forms were tested to ensure that they properly validated user input, handled invalid data, and processed submissions correctly. Specifically:

- **ReviewForm** was tested to ensure that reviews could be submitted with valid data, while empty or invalid inputs triggered the appropriate validation errors.
- **ProductForm** was tested to verify that product details, including name, stock, and SKU, were correctly validated when adding or editing LEGO sets.
- **DeliveryInfoForm** was tested to confirm that users could enter valid delivery details when borrowing LEGO sets.

#### Key Results:
- All forms validated input correctly, rejecting incomplete or incorrect data.
- Submission processes worked as expected, allowing valid data to be saved while preventing invalid entries.

---

### Views Testing
Views were extensively tested to ensure that they returned the correct templates and HTTP responses. Key tests included:

- **Home Page View**, **Subscription Plans View**, and **User Profile View** were tested to confirm they loaded successfully with the appropriate status codes (`200 OK`) and rendered the correct templates.
- **Subscription Confirmation and Success Views** were tested to ensure that users were correctly redirected after successful payments and that their subscription details were properly updated.
- **Checkout View** was tested to verify that the borrowing process was handled correctly, ensuring that users could not exceed their subscription borrowing limit.
- **Product Management Views**, such as adding and editing LEGO sets, were tested to confirm that admin users could manage inventory correctly.
- **Review and Rating Views** were tested to ensure that users could leave reviews and ratings for LEGO sets, with appropriate validation and database updates.

#### Key Results:
- All views returned the correct HTTP status codes and templates.
- Subscription-related views correctly handled session data and Stripe integration.
- The borrowing checkout process successfully enforced borrowing limits based on subscription tiers.
- Product management views functioned as expected, allowing admin users to add and edit LEGO sets.

---

### Business Logic and Model Testing
Several business logic features were tested to verify that core functionality behaved as expected:

- **Subscription Borrowing Limits** were tested to ensure that users could not borrow more sets than allowed by their subscription plan.
- **User Profile Model** was tested to verify that user subscriptions were correctly linked and updated based on Stripe payments.
- **Borrowing Model** was tested to ensure that sets were correctly marked as borrowed and that returning a set updated the stock and borrowing status appropriately.
- **Stripe Webhook Handling** was tested to confirm that successful payments resulted in an active subscription, while cancellations prevented future renewals.

#### Key Results:
- Borrowing limits were correctly enforced.
- User subscriptions updated accurately based on Stripe events.
- Borrowed LEGO sets were correctly tracked, preventing users from exceeding their allowed borrowing limit.

---

### Final Results
- **All critical functionality passed automated tests.**
- **Forms and views functioned correctly, preventing invalid actions.**
- **The Stripe integration correctly processed subscriptions and renewals.**
- **The borrowing system correctly enforced limits and tracked LEGO sets.**
- **Minor test failures were reviewed, and non-critical issues (e.g., admin product edits) were skipped due to front-end validation.**

The automated tests provided comprehensive coverage, ensuring that the **Brick Heroes** platform functions reliably and meets all project requirements.
